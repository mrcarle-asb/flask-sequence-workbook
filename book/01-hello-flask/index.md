# Week 1: Hello Flask

This week you build your first Flask app — a Python program that serves web pages at different URLs. Every page is generated by a Python function. Welcome to the dynamic web.

## What you already know

- Basic Python: functions, strings, `return`, `import`
- You've used `import random` and `from random import randint`

## What's new this week

- The Flask library and the `Flask` class
- The `app` object
- Route decorators (`@app.route`)
- Route variables (`<name>`)
- Running a development server with `flask run --debug`

## The assignment

By the end of this week you'll have a multi-route Flask app where every URL serves a different page. All content starts as inline HTML strings — ugly, but functional. That ugliness is the motivation for Week 2.

Read the pages in this section in order. Each one builds on the last.
