# Week 1: Hello Flask

This week you build your first Flask app — a Python program that serves web pages at different URLs. Every page is generated by a Python function. Welcome to the dynamic web.

**Build** means build. Open your repo, type the code, run it, see it in a browser. Reading this page is step zero, not the finish line.

## Why Flask?

Your IB Internal Assessment requires you to build a working software solution for a real client. For most of you, that will be a web application — and Flask is the tool we use to build it.

This sequence teaches you Flask one piece at a time so that when you sit down to design your own app, you've already done each piece before. Separately. In order. With bumpers.

## What you already know

- Basic Python: functions, strings, `return`, `import`
- You've used `import random` and `from random import randint`

## What's new this week

- The Flask library and the `Flask` class
- The `app` object
- Route decorators (`@app.route`)
- Route variables (`<name>`)
- `render_template()` and the `templates/` folder
- Running a development server with `flask run --debug`

## The assignment

By the end of this week you'll have a multi-route Flask app where each URL serves a different HTML page from the `templates/` folder. This is the skeleton that every Flask project — including your IA — will be built on.

Read the pages in this section in order. Each one builds on the last.
