# Flask Sequence — IB Computer Science

A ladder of six assignments that take you from zero Flask knowledge to a full CRUD web application. Each assignment builds on the last. You never start from nothing.

```
Weeks 1-3: Record of Tasks (main quest)
  1. flask-hello         Routes and strings
  2. flask-templates     Jinja2 and base.html
  3. flask-tasks-file    Forms and file I/O

Weeks 4-5: Birthdays (side quest)
  4. flask-birthdays-sql    Raw SQL with CS50 library
  5. flask-birthdays-orm    SQLAlchemy + Flask-WTF (group merge)

Week 6: Record of Tasks (return with new powers)
  6. flask-plateau          Full CRUD rebuild
```

Each week introduces one cluster of new skills. The starter code always runs before you write anything.

## How to use this workbook

This is **not** a replacement for the live demo or the assignment repo. It's the reference you open when you're stuck at 10pm and need to remember what `@app.route` does, or why your function returns instead of prints.

Use the sidebar to navigate to your current week. Use the glossary (linked terms appear throughout) to look up any concept.
