# Flask Sequence — IB Computer Science

## Where this is going

By the end of this sequence, you will build a web application from scratch — a Flask app that creates, reads, updates, and deletes data in a database. A CRUD app.

This is not the IA. This is the **minimum build path** to get you to the point where the IA is even possible. If you cannot build a basic CRUD app, you cannot build an IA. These skills are table stakes — the things you need to have *before* you start thinking about your own project, your own client, your own data model.

Week 6 is where you prove it: you'll design and build a complete CRUD application on your own. Think of it as a dress rehearsal for the complexity of the IA, not a mini version of the assessment itself.

```
Weeks 1-3: Record of Tasks (main quest)
  1. flask-hello         Routes and strings
  2. flask-templates     Jinja2 and base.html
  3. flask-tasks-file    Forms and file I/O

Weeks 4-5: Birthdays (side quest)
  4. flask-birthdays-sql    Raw SQL with CS50 library
  5. flask-birthdays-orm    SQLAlchemy + Flask-WTF (group merge)

Week 6: Record of Tasks (return with new powers)
  6. flask-plateau          Full CRUD rebuild — your dress rehearsal
```

Each week builds on the last. The starter code always runs before you write anything. You never start from nothing.

## This is a sequence of things to DO

:::alert{warn}
Reading this workbook and thinking "yeah, I get it" is not the same as doing it. Every page describes something you should **build, run, and test** in your own repo. If you haven't typed the code and seen it work in a browser, you haven't done the step.

The concepts here are not hard one at a time. They become hard when you skip steps, fall behind, and have to learn three things at once. The bumpers are here. Stay in the lane.

## How to use this workbook

This is **not** a replacement for the live demo or the assignment repo. It's the reference you open when you're stuck at 10pm and need to remember what `@app.route` does, or why your function returns instead of prints.

Use the sidebar to navigate to your current week. Use the glossary (linked terms appear throughout) to look up any concept.
