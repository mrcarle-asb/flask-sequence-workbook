Uniform Resource Locator. The address format for web resources: `computer:port/resource`. For example, `localhost:5000/about` means "ask the server running on this computer, port 5000, for the resource at `/about`." URLs were invented at CERN as a way to locate specific files shared by HTTP servers.
